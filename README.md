# Twitter Mining Using Raspberry Pi
Rather than running one Tweepy session a day, which results in tweets that are ony from one time period of the day, this project works with Raspberry Pi to _collect tweets continuously throughout the day_ (within the Twitter API rate-limit). This project is fully open-source under the MIT License.

### Crontab ###
Automate the running of the Twitter mining Python script by creating a cron job in the Raspberry Pi terminal.  


Enter into the cron editor by entering the following BASH command:__
`pi@raspberrypi:~ $ crontab -e`__
  
Format the cron job with the following cron expression:__
`*/10 07-23 * * * cd /home/pi/Sync/twitter && /usr/bin/python3.7 collect_tweets_master.py`  

* `*/10 07-23 * * *`: executing every 10 mins from 7 am to midnight _[minute hour day(month) month day(week)]_
* `cd /home/pi/Sync/twitter`: changing directory to the folder that contains the python file
* `/usr/bin/python3.7`: folder that contains the Python version to be used
* `collect_tweets_master.py`: Python file that is to be run
